# Verify Your Code!

You're ready to run your first AI-powered code verification!

## How It Works

1. **You write code** normally in VS Code
2. **CVA watches** for file changes
3. **AI tribunal** evaluates code against your constitution
4. **Verdicts appear** as inline hints and in the sidebar

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+V` | Verify entire workspace |
| `Ctrl+Alt+V` | Verify current file |

## Understanding Verdicts

- ✅ **PASS** - Your code follows all rules
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Some issues found, not critical
- ❌ **FAIL** - Critical violations detected
- 🚫 **VETO** - Security judge blocked the code

## What's Next?

- Check the **CVA Verdicts** panel in the sidebar
- Click on issues to jump to the problematic code
- Fix issues and re-verify!

Happy vibe coding! 🎉
